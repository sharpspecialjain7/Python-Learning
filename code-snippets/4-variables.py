# naming convention for variables
    # variable names should be descriptive and should make sense of the value it is holding
    # use _ to seperate two words in a variabe. example: user_name
    # numbers can be used in a variable, numbers should not be the first character though
    # should not be reserved keywords
    # A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
    # Variable names are case-sensitive
    # A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores
    # A variable when declared need to be defined

# Below throws NameError: name 'user_name' is not defined
#user_name
#print(user_name)
